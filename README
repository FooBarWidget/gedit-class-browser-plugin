-- CLASS BROWSER PLUGIN --

This is a development release of the class browser plugin for gedit.
It works on with recent gedit versions. 

It contains two code parsers:
 * a generic parser based on ctags-exuberant (ctags must be installed)
 * a python parser
 * a ruby parser
 * a parser for diff files
